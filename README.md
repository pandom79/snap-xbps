SYNOPSIS

This is a set of xbps hooks and script that automatically causes snapper to
perform a pre and post snapshot before and after pacman transactions, similar to
how YaST does with OpenSuse. This provides a simple way to undo changes to a
system after a xbps transaction.

INSTALLATION

Install the "snap-xbps" package using xbps.

Alternatively download the latest release from
https://github.com/pandom79/snap-xbps/releases, and then
run "make install".

DOCUMENTATION

See snap-xbps(8) after installation.
